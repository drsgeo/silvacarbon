                                    Forest monitoring can be a tool for implementing emissions reductions by using Early Warning (EW) systems that detect deforestation
                                    daily, weekly, or monthly. The frequency and low latency of EW systems make it possible for law enforcement and other actors to respond
                                    rapidly to deforestation events, potentially halting further forest clearing.

                                    While EW systems have been implemented in countries like Brazil for over a decade, these systems have only recently existed in Southeast
                                    Asia. As a result, the SilvaCarbon program and the World Resources Instituteâ€™s Global Forest Watch program are co-organizing a regional
                                    workshop under the Global Forest Observation Initiative umbrella to bring together forest monitoring actors from Bangladesh, Cambodia,
                                    Laos, Nepal, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam to demonstrate existing EW systems, showcase future developments, and share experiences
                                    around the creation and use of EW systems.

                                    Sustainable management of mangroves is a crucial component of global efforts to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Mangroves store
                                    large amounts of carbon, protect coastlines from tropical cyclones, and harbor high biodiversity. In addition,  mangroves are critical
                                    ecosystems for coastal communities.

                                    This workshop aimed to showcase the latest mangrove mapping and carbon estimation methods and emphasize how mapping and field inventories
                                    complement one another. Developing countries with REDD+ programs need to (a) identify the geographic extent of mangrove forests, and (b)
                                    estimate carbon stocks per hectare (i.e., emissions factors) in order to estimate carbon emissions from land-use changes. Although
                                    different individuals (and possibly agencies) may be responsible for mapping efforts and field inventories in specific countries, we aimed
                                    to create a dialog between these individuals and provide a complete picture of how to estimate carbon emissions from changes in mangrove
                                    forest cover.

                                    In the field of climate change, despite the advances in gender awareness and inclusion, prejudices, and stereotypes continue to hinder
                                    women from participating in technical sectors and those related to carbon science such as forest monitoring and reporting of greenhouse
                                    gas (GHG) inventories. Additionally, women's unequal participation in decision-making processes and labor markets exacerbates
                                    inequalities and often prevents women from fully contributing to forest conservation and climate-related policy planning,
                                    policymaking, and implementation. The SilvaCarbon LACC team, interested in contributing to reducing gender bias in its areas of impact,
                                    began exploring a joint initiative with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Colorado State

                                    activities in the forestry sector; Share the experiences of women in technical management positions and their valuable contributions;
                                    and develop a set of recommendations on how to address gender issues and share them with relevant ministries/agencies in Latin America
                                    and the Caribbean. In addition, simultaneous interpretation was provided in Spanish and English and there were 308 participants from

                                    SilvaCarbon, in collaboration with Google Earth Engine (GEE), organized this past July 4th a one-day training on the GEE platform
                                    where female students from the National University of AsunciÃ³n from Geography and other related careers were invited to participate.
                                    GEE is a web-based platform that combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with analytics
                                    capabilities, enabling analysis of large volumes of data. This training provided a brief overview of the main options for interacting
                                    with this platform, including the Code Editor, a web-based IDE for writing and running scripts, and Explorer, a lightweight web
                                    application for exploring data catalogs and running simple analyses. Satellite imagery analysis were done during the training,
                                    creating cloudless mosaics and plotting time series data. During this workshop students became familiar with Earth Engine Geospatial
                                    Objects and their associated functions: images and collections of images, features and collections of features, and geometries.
                                    They improved the capacity of remote sensing data: analysis and mapping using GEE. Assisted participants in exploring GEE functions
                                    and tools for their work in forest cover mapping and monitoring and other applications and ultimately processed large files of
                                    satellite images and perform simple analyses.

                                    UNFCCC (and other initiatives) can be shared. This is to identify the main problems faced by countries in the evaluation and
                                    improvement of these reports and to add to support Latin American and Caribbean countries and guide the efforts of improvement of
                                    FREL/FRL and Technical Annexes.

                                    The SilvaCarbon program and the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) co-organized a regional workshop to bring
                                    together i) national land monitoring experts and GHG inventory analysts from Paraguay, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and 
                                    Guatemala; ii) global land monitoring experts from the CEOS group; and iii) LULUCF experts nominated in the UNFCCC roster by their
                                    governments or contributors to the 2019 refinement of the IPCC guidelines.  Participants discussed the new capabilities for measuring
                                    biomass from space and how they can be integrated with plot data to improve NFIs and GHG inventories following IPCC guidance. The
                                    workshop included a 1-day field trip to a forest plot to validate a model to map biomass combining GEDI and plot data that has been
                                    tested by INFONA and the US Forest Service.

                                    One of the areas affected by the pandemic has undoubtedly been the in-person education. Therefore, institutions have sought to 
                                    implement new forms of online teaching and e-learning to avoid a lapse in capacity transfer by the inability to teach in person.
                                    As a result, many online courses were developed and delivered using recently created digital platforms, both public and private.
                                    The new modalities of online teaching occurred in all disciplines, including the forestry and land monitoring area. Different
                                    partners and experts begin to generate technical assistance content for the countries in measurement, reporting, and verification
                                    of emissions (MRV). At first, participating in these online assistances was manageable. Still, as time passed and the creators
                                    became more skilled every day, the selection of online seminars became quite overwhelming for the participants.

                                    SilvaCarbon, in collaboration with FAO and GFOI and other partners such as the World Bank, etc., recognized the opportunity that
                                    comes from having these significant amounts of technical assistance resources that exist in the cloud and that could be organized
                                    in a way that countries can find access and act. The first version for this webinar was delivered to the LAC region this past June.
