                                        UNFCCC negotiations have identified the need to establish national forest monitoring systems that use an appropriate combination of remote sensing and ground-based forest carbon inventory 
                                        approaches for estimating anthropogenic forest-related greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks to support REDD+ implementation and assessing performance in implementing
                                        REDD+ activities.  Efforts to improve country monitoring capacities are ongoing, and a series of global and regional datasets have been produced by the research community. These global
                                        and regional products become increasingly relevant, spurred by the REDD+ monitoring requirements, and aided by the communications efforts of initiatives such as Global Forest Watch and
                                        recently the Global Observation Forests Initiative (GFOI) has provided a module  with initial advice on the possible use of global datasets in the context of national monitoring. Beyond 
                                        that, there is little additional guidance on their use for national forest monitoring, change estimation, or reporting and over the past 24 months, a number of experiences on the use of
                                        global data products have been collected in different country circumstances. It is timely and relevant for a collection and exchange of these experiences to guide future research, guidance
                                        documents, and communication on the use of global data products. Central actors in the field have expressed the value of, and their interest in, such an effort.

                                        This workshop was designated to expose partners to different processing methods, classifications, quality assessments, and derivation of time derived spectral features.  Additionally,
                                        the workshop helped to improve the technical knowledge on mapping forest change using time series analysis systems; and help to coordinate the next steps for time series systems
                                        capacity transfer.  The workshop showcased all the technical and financial aspects for running several Landsat based time-series analyses for detecting cover forest change.  The
                                        leading experts of these methodologies presented their methods before the workshop in a Landsat scene in the Lâm Đồng province of Vietnam.  An accuracy assessment was conducted prior
                                        to the workshop, and it was used as a base for discussing the differences among the change detection products produced by each method.  Vietnam representatives had the opportunity to
                                        discuss, verify, and explore the dynamics of forest cover change using Google Earth Engine and the TimeSync Landsat time-series Visualization tool.  The overall goal of the workshop 
                                        was to identify the method that will be more suitable for Vietnam to adapt in the future considering their resources and technical capacity.  In the future, a second intensive workshop
                                        will be scheduled for hands on training in one of the methodologies if Vietnam considers them suitable.

                                        The science of predicting and responding to future forest conditions involves several components.  First, identifying the drivers of forest loss and degradation is needed to parameterize
                                        predictive models. This can involve studying relationships between known loss and degradation and the factors that affect these activities, such as areas of population expansion, illegal
                                        logging, or road building. Second, the identification of modeling approaches that integrate these data into models requires both statistical methods and technological skills in the area of
                                        geospatial analysis, geographic information systems, and remote sensing. Third, applying models and identifying future forest conditions, along with hot spots of high priority concern, 
                                        allows managers to focus their efforts in these areas. Finally, adaptation to future conditions is a critical component – the identification of strategies for working with local, regional
                                        and national partners to address ecological problems that are expected to occur in the future is essential.

                                        The third edition of the GFOI Technical Workshops for South and Southeast Asia brought together remote sensing and GIS specialists from forestry departments, national mapping  authorities
                                        and satellite agencies from seven SilvaCarbon countries to learn about the opportunities  and challenges for applying radar data for forest monitoring in the context of REDD+.  Experts from
                                        several institutions, leading the current research  on radar data application, presented the basic principles of radar technology, provided overview of the  different radar data sources and
                                        outlined some of the key functions of radar data relevant for forest monitoring. Practical  exercises for radar data interpretation and for processing ALOS data were included in the program
                                        to give participants general idea of steps involved in radar data processing. Much of the discussions focused on the utility of radar data for forest monitoring and improving forestry data 
                                        at national level. It was emphasized that defining the key purpose for using radar data and the level of details required is very important as this influences the type of radar sensor and

                                        On the last day, participants highlighted the interest to use radar data for supplementing optical data to increase accuracy and quality of forest maps at national level.  Forest cover mapping
                                        and biomass estimation were identified as priority topics for further capacity building and research. It was agreed to plan for a longer, practical training on radar data processing focused on
                                        forest cover mapping. It was also agreed that countries will identify priority locations for obtaining radar data, and these will be shared with the GFOI for consideration in the data
                                        acquisition strategy.

                                        The main objective of this GFOI workshop in INPE, Brazil is to showcase the methodologies of existing early warning systems to the Americas SilvaCarbon countries:

                                        Ecuador, Colombia, Peru and Mexico. Systems such as DETER (Deforestation Detection in RealTime) from INPE will be discussed and analyzed. One half day of this workshop will focus solely on fire
                                        early warning systems and their important in detecting degradation. This workshop is essential to illustrate the effectiveness of these systems as an articulated set <br>of procedures through 
                                        which it collects and processes information about foreseeable threats, and prevent deforestation. Early warning systems are vital to the forest conservation and this showcase will help Latin
                                        American countries to learn from these systems and move closer to real-time monitoring.
