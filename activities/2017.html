										Within the Framework of Cooperation of the Forest Observing Group (GFOI), the SilvaCarbon program has been working with the countries of the Americas (Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, and Colombia)
										since 2011 to develop technical capacities to monitor forest for monitoring and reporting of carbon emissions. Since 2011, 14 regional workshops have been developed focusing on themes 
										relevant to forest monitoring. At the same time, the SilvaCarbon program, supported by universities in the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands, has transferred different methodologies
										using remote sensors for the continuous mapping of forest loss and gain. This workshop seeks to exchange the experiences of these countries in the implementation of different mapping 
										methodologies as well as experiences in assessing the uncertainty of the estimation of the change in forest cover. The objective is to develop a lesson learned document that will guide
										countries that are starting the work of implementing a monitoring system, as well as providing Latin American countries with a forum for discussion and exchange of knowledge through the
										review of efforts In the past and guides for the future.

                                        The performance-based climate mitigation framework REDD+ encourages the reduction of emissions related to deforestation and forest degradation, and removals through enhanced forest carbon
                                        stocks and improved forest management. These activities should be measured and reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which requires methodologies for
                                        estimating actual emissions and removals and for establishing the reference level. UNFCCC requests countries to build robust and transparent national forest monitoring systems to facilitate 
                                        the measurement and reporting of forest related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, following the guidelines and guidance from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

                                        Various training materials and tools are available that aim to support and facilitate country processes with the development of capacities for implementing a national system for monitoring
                                        forest area and area changes, the associated carbon stocks and changes; and for measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) of REDD+ activities. To make these materials more accessible for
                                        countries and REDD+ / forest monitoring professionals, four (4) regional one week workshops are planned in three different continents: one in South-East Asia (in English), one in Latin America
                                        (in Spanish) and two in Africa (in French and English). The basic concept of these workshop is to “train the trainers”. A selected group of around 35 participants from countries in each region
                                        (2-3 per country) will attend with the aim of further disseminating the gained knowledge and insights and train other relevant people who are involved in REDD+ monitoring and reporting in
                                        their country, in order to further build their capacities.

                                        This workshop seeks to review methodologies associated with different sources of remote sensing used for biomass estimation, whether Landsat data, SAR data, or LiDAR. In addition to review
                                        critical issues associated with biomass estimation methods, such as field data available plots, uncertainty analysis of estimates, use of suitable algorithms, and use of metrics suitable for
                                        biomass models; it seeks to invite experts who have developed methodologies either with a sensor or multi-sensors for a comparative analysis on a regional scale. There are two parts to the
                                        workshop: a two-day meeting reviewing and discussing existing methods of biomass estimation, followed by a three-day field visit to gain field experience in a variety of biomass intensity
                                        settings.
