                                    for viewing through the REDDcompass online portal. By linking UNFCCC reporting requirements with the IPCC’s good practice guidance,
                                    the MGD provides a systematic workflow approach to guide countries through the complex process of developing forest monitoring and
                                    MRV systems for REDD+. The MGD 2.0 provides a full update and extension of the first edition and presents improved and extended methods
                                    and guidance.  It will form a key element of GFOI partners’ assistance to developing countries. The document is currently available
                                    only in English, but French and Spanish translations will be available by the end of the year.  The GFOI Office would like to
                                    acknowledge the significant contributions from many partners in the developing the MGD 2.0. In particular we would like to acknowledge
                                    the late Prof. Jim Penman. We hope that Jim is looking down on us and feeling an immense sense of pride and satisfaction. As a mark of
                                    respect, the MGD 2.0 has been dedicated to Jim in recognition of his longstanding contribution and commitment to the MGD and broader

                                    The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiations have underscored the importance of establishing
                                    transparent national forest monitoring systems. These systems produce vital information on forest carbon stocks and dynamics to
                                    support a wide range of national and international objectives, including REDD+ and the implementation and tracking of Nationally
                                    Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the UNFCCC. According to international guidance, national forest monitoring systems should 
                                    integrate both remote sensing and forest inventory approaches for generating accurate estimates of forest carbon emissions and
                                    removals, and should be based on replicable and consistent methods.

                                    SilvaCarbon works with developing countries to build technical capacities for forest carbon monitoring and strengthen the underlying
                                    science. Since 2011, the program has provided targeted technical assistance to 21 countries to support the design and implementation
                                    of national forest monitoring systems and measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems for REDD+. Through extensive
                                    engagement with in-country practitioners and international experts, SilvaCarbon has identified critical research needs that must be
                                    addressed in order to overcome the current and future technical challenges facing country partners.

                                    In response to those needs, the SilvaCarbon Global Program has awarded eleven research grants to U.S. and international scientists
                                    focused on applying cutting-edge technologies and methodologies for measuring and monitoring forest carbon. This research, now
                                    complete, addresses key knowledge gaps relevant to REDD+ implementation, UNFCCC reporting, and other efforts which require improved
                                    data and information on forest dynamics and associated carbon dynamics. SilvaCarbon is organizing an international workshop in
                                    Washington, D.C. to share results from this research, assess remaining knowledge gaps, and advance research implementation.

                                    Workshop Objectives: As countries progress in the development of their forest carbon monitoring and MRV systems, it is becoming
                                    increasingly important to facilitate the exchange of technical knowledge and experiences. This exchange is essential for guiding
                                    future research, developing practical guidance and capacity-building resources, and disseminating new tools and methods that are
                                    appropriate to countries’ unique needs and circumstances.  With this in mind, the workshop will bring together scientists,
                                    international cooperation agencies, and national practitioners to increase global understanding of emerging tools and methods for
                                    measuring and monitoring forest carbon. The event will foster learning and collaboration through a combination of presentations,
                                    focused discussions, and interactive activities, and will seek to identify priorities for potential future research and develop
                                    an action plan for improving the underlying science of national forest monitoring in REDD+ countries.

                                    South-East Asia (in English), one in Latin America (in Spanish) and two in Africa (in French and English). The basic concept of
                                    these workshop is to “train the trainers”. A selected group of around 35 participants from countries in each region (2-3 per country)
                                    will attend with the aim of further disseminating the gained knowledge and insights and train other relevant people who are involved
                                    in REDD+ monitoring and reporting in their country, in order to further build their capacities.  The workshops will be jointly
                                    organized in close collaboration with the different training and capacity building initiatives from World Bank FCPF, GFOI,
                                    Silvacarbon, FAO/UN-REDD,REDD+ partnership, Wageningen University, GOFC-GOLD, and Boston University. Organization of the workshops
                                    will be under the coordinating leadership of Wageningen University.

                                    Workshop Objectives: This workshop from 4 to 7 July in Lima, Peru, was the second of the series of four regional workshops. The aim
                                    of the workshop is to build upon existing expertise and experiences and to use available training materials and tools in a broad
                                    capacity development context to help build a countries’ capacities and to spread the use and increase the impact of available
                                    knowledge and tools.

                                    After the successful completion of the workshop, participants should be able to become ‘multipliers’ by further disseminating the
                                    knowledge and experience gained and train other relevant people who are involved in REDD+ monitoring and reporting in their country.
                                    In the workshops, participants learn about the different training materials and tools that are available and how these different
                                    materials all fit together in the “bigger picture” of REDD+ MRV capacity building. Participants will also know how and where to make
                                    request for further appropriate training and make use of available tools for implementation. A direct interaction with leading
                                    international experts present at the workshop will be facilitated so specific issues can be discussed face to face.

                                    Forest inventory plot design is a subject great debate. Not only do inventory experts debate the proper shape, size, and number,
                                    configuration, and separation distance between subplots, but remote sensing specialists also consider training and accuracy assessment
                                    plot characteristics critical to their work.

                                    Forest inventory plots should thus be designed to meet both inventory and remote sensing data needs in the most efficient way. However,
                                    there are often competing interests in plot design. For example, inventory efficiency might be maximized with small clusters of plots
                                    separated by small distances, whereas remote sensing specialists might prefer plots that are large and correspond with remote sensing
                                    pixel configuration. Similarly, ecologists interested in species diversity might prefer plots more suited for the generation of
                                    species-area curves. The motivation for the workshop is thus to discuss the theory behind inventory plot design in different concepts,
                                    and to attempt to arrive at common ground when considering competing interests in the face of a limited budget. The structure of the
                                    workshop included a mixture of technical presentations of work in this area from experts, group discussion, and interactive, hands-on
                                    experiments aimed at giving participants a practical understanding of the concepts of plot design. A field activity that involves

                                    The overall goal of the workshop was to provide participants from the SilvaCarbon South and Southeast Asia countries with an
                                    understanding of past and ongoing forest cover map accuracy assessment efforts and to provide guidance for enhancing future activities.

                                    The Philippines, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia are currently engaged in accuracy assessments of their existing maps with support
                                    from FAO and SilvaCarbon.  At this workshop, practical issues identified through this ongoing work will be discussed in more detail,
                                    including area estimation, uncertainty analysis (for different tiers) and forest stratification.  The workshop will also share the
                                    latest international guidance provided by GFOI’s Methods and Guidance Documentation (MGD) on accuracy assessment/area estimation and
                                    will an offer opportunity to discuss how the current efforts in the countries can be aligned accordingly.  The information shared at
                                    the workshop will form the basis for discussing national-level activities related to accuracy assessment and area estimation of land
                                    cover change in all participating countries.
