                                    <h5 class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                   		SilvaCarbon is an interagency technical cooperation program of the US Government to enhance the capacity of selected tropical countries to measure, monitor, and report carbon in
                                   		their forests and other lands. Drawing on the expertise of multiple US Government agencies and partners, the program provides targeted technical support to countries in the process
                                   		of developing and implementing national forest and landscape monitoring systems. SilvaCarbon leverages state-of-the-art science and technology to advance the generation and use of
                                   		improved information related to forest and terrestrial carbon
                                    </h5>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                    	Tropical deforestation and forest degradation pose a serious threat to people, economies, and biodiversity worldwide. Vital forest resources continue to disappear at an alarming
                                    	rate in many tropical countries, undermining economic development and exacerbating social and environmental challenges. To address this concern, decision makers need more and better
                                    	information about how forests and other landscapes are changing over time. There is a growing need for improved information about changes in forest and terrestrial carbon, in
                                    	particular, to strengthen forest and land use management and planning, curb forest loss through mechanisms such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
                                    	(REDD+), and track and meet sustainable development goals.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                    	Recognizing this need, many tropical countries have prioritized the establishment of national forest and landscape monitoring systems. National forest and landscape monitoring
                                    	systems integrate satellite imagery and other remote sensing data with ground-based forest inventory data to generate accurate, up-to-date information about forest and landscape
                                    	dynamics and associated carbon dynamics. This information supports multiple objectives and is essential for guiding decisions related to conserving forests and biodiversity,
                                    	combatting illegal logging, and responding to climate change. National forest and landscape monitoring systems also contribute to greater transparency and accountability, helping
                                    	to level the playing field for international trade, private investment, and multilateral accords. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                    	Recent years have seen the rapid advancement of forest and landscape monitoring science and technology. This includes impressive improvements in satellite data availability and
                                    	quality along with improved ground measurements, enhanced modeling capabilities, and increased knowledge through research. While these advancements offer tremendous potential
                                    	for improved forest and landscape monitoring, many countries face technical challenges identifying and implementing monitoring approaches that suit their unique needs.
                                    	International collaboration is critical for supporting the establishment of robust, sustainable national forest monitoring systems that are appropriate to countries’ individual
                                    	circumstances.

                                    	With this in mind, US federal agencies have joined together to create the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon capitalizes on the accumulated expertise of the US scientific and
                                    	technical community to build capacity worldwide for monitoring, measuring, and reporting forest and terrestrial carbon. In conjunction with tropical developing nations and

										SilvaCarbon began working with the Andean Amazon countries of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru in 2011, and expanded to include the Central American and Caribbean countries of
										Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama in 2014. The shared language, depth of experiences, and ongoing communication and
										technical support across Latin and America and the Caribbean contribute to excellent opportunities for South-South collaboration. SilvaCarbon capitalizes on these
										opportunities by providing country-specific support to individual countries and facilitating cooperation and knowledge exchange at the regional level.

									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										The SilvaCarbon Latin America and Caribbean Regional Program builds capacity for national-level forest carbon Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for countries
										across the REDD+ readiness spectrum, complementing other donor efforts to assist governments in the region to track forest emissions. While countries in the region have
										significantly advanced in the use of remote sensing products and the implementation of forest inventories, critical capacity gaps remain. Countries seek targeted assistance 
										from SilvaCarbon related to reporting results, mitigation activities, and strengthening institutional capacities to ensure the long-term sustainability of monitoring efforts.
									</p>
									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										Based on identified country needs, the SilvaCarbon Latin America and Caribbean Regional Program currently focuses on three technical areas: (1) implementing national forest
										inventories that are consistent and can be integrated with remote sensing products generated to estimate change areas, and consistently mapping land use classes beyond forests
										with a replicable methodology; (2) reporting forest degradation; and (3) developing the regional community of forest and terrestrial carbon technical experts.

														With technical support from SilvaCarbon, Peru finalized its <span class="hl">first forest dynamics map</span> and is completing the 
														<span class="hl">first phase of its national forest inventory</span>. Ecuador also completed its <span class="hl">first national forest inventory</span> and 
														<span class="hl">first forest-change map</span> for an area typically covered by clouds. Colombia was able to <span class="hl">generate estimates of forest cover change</span>
														annually for the first time, as well as develop a <span class="hl">national forest inventory plan</span>. SilvaCarbon assistance with national forest inventories in the
														three countries effectively created the <span class="hl">first detailed "census" of the biologically diverse and globally important Andean Amazon region</span>, and will
														enable the generation of detailed, systematic information for national GHG accounting and policy decisions.  In addition, SilvaCarbon helped install 
														<span class="hl">intensive carbon monitoring sites</span> in all three countries to advance understanding of forest-climate dynamics, build capacities for using new 
														carbon monitoring techniques, and provide research opportunities for scientists and students.

														SilvaCarbon technical exchanges have brought together stakeholders from across Central America and the Caribbean to 
														<span class="hl">build national forest monitoring capacities</span> and support the use of appropriate <span class="hl">tools and methodologies</span> for measuring and monitoring
														forest carbon at national and regional scales. These exchanges have been instrumental in developing a <span class="hl">regional community of forest monitoring experts</span>
														and equipping countries to address <span class="hl">key technical challenges</span> related to forest inventory planning and design, forest attributes and sampling, allometric

												The SilvaCarbon Bangladesh program, initiated in 2014 with funding from USAID-Bangladesh, is assisting the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD) and other institutions in Bangladesh with the
												development of the country’s first national forest monitoring system. SilvaCarbon activities in Bangladesh are coordinated by in-country program staff based in Dhaka, and are closely 
												coordinated with parallel efforts led by FAO.

												Bangladesh’s biologically rich forests and wetlands, including the internationally recognized Sundarbans mangrove forest, provide crucial economic, social, and environmental benefits for
												the country, region, and world. As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries on Earth, Bangladesh depends on its forests and wetlands for protection against climate-related impacts such
												as catastrophic floods and other disasters. The country has lost over half of its forests in the last 30 years, however, and its remaining forested areas are critically threatened.
											</p>
											<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
												The Government of Bangladesh is committed to addressing these challenges by building forest monitoring capacities across government, civil society, and industry, and by participating in
												REDD+. As part of those efforts, the country has recently begun developing its first national forest monitoring system. As the responsible agency, the BFD has prioritized the development
												of a robust, sustainable, and cost-effective national forest monitoring system that leverages the strengths of both ground-based forest inventory data and remote sensing data. SilvaCarbon
												is providing technical support to help the nation achieve this goal.

												importance of forest monitoring, forest inventory, and GHG accounting information for achieving multiple objectives, including guiding forest management and conservation planning, 
												supporting REDD+, and fulfilling national and international reporting requirements.
											</p>
											<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
												SilvaCarbon support for Vietnam is coordinated by a local advisor based in Hanoi, and currently addresses three interrelated technical areas: (1) improving the accuracy and statistical

												in the region, and some countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam) have developed forest-specific emission reduction targets.
											</p>
											<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
												With this in mind, SilvaCarbon programming in the region focuses primarily on two technical areas: 1) developing in-country forest mapping and reporting products and capacities,

                                            Degraded forests are poorly studied. Despite the rapidly accumulating number of lidar studies, degraded forests are rarely used for calibration. With the exception of some long-term

                                            In this proposal, the research team proposes an alternative method for monitoring land change that makes use of all available observations ever acquired by the Landsat
                                            satellite for a pixel. Studying a time series of observations rather than comparing individual images or maps makes it possible to continuously monitor the land cover at
                                            pixel-level in time. While never implemented in Colombia, the proposed methodology has proven capable of mapping stable and changing land cover with high levels of

                                            In Central African countries, where deforestation has historically been low, but where logging occurs in over 70% of the forests in some countries, forest degradation may
                                            be the most important source of carbon emissions. The uncertainty in quantifying the area affected and the carbon loss through degradation, particularly from selective logging,
                                            is large because conventional methods of remote sensing and surveying are not sensitive enough to precisely measure degradation. However, advances in high resolution remote

                                            There are two general approaches to carbon estimation that show promise for MRV-model-based and model-assisted estimation. Model-based estimation in the context of forest
                                            attribute mapping relies on a set of modeled, pixel-based estimates, generally in the form of a map derived from remotely sensed data. Precision estimates can come from 
                                            analyzing the set of pixel values, their uncertainties, and their spatial covariance. Model-assisted estimation is based on a probabilistic design in which ground plots
                                            along with auxiliary data from maps derived from remote sensing are used to generate estimates of forest parameters and their variance.

                                            Human-caused disturbance to tropical forests, such as through intentional use and resource extraction or through unintentional wildfires, cause substantial losses of carbon stocks.
                                            But does tropical forest degradation lead to permanent carbon losses?  This is a critical question to address in the context of policy discussions to implement REDD+ (Reduced Emissions
                                            from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus enhancement of forest carbon stocks through conservation and sustainable forest management).  We propose to review the current scientific
                                            knowledge about the temporal and spatial dynamics of degradation--‐induced carbon emissions to build a coherent picture of the pattern of emissions from different types of degradation
                                            across tropical forest regions. Using best available information, we will: i) develop emissions factors (per area) for different types and scenarios of degradation; ii) describe the
                                            temporal pattern of degradation emissions and recovery trajectory post--‐disturbance; and iii) assess the evidence that demonstrates how tropical forest degradation leads to a lower
                                            carbon state, either through arrested succession, a switch to an alternate vegetation state, or facilitation of future deforestation. The overarching goal of this research is to
                                            synthesize existing knowledge on the range of initial gross and longer-term net carbon emissions from different types of degradation activities across tropical regions.

                                            Deforestation and forest degradation account for nearly 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any sector other than the energy sector (UN REDD, 2009). REDD (Reducing 
                                            Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) is a mechanism designed under the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change to financially
                                            support developing countries that are willing and able to reduce emissions from deforestation and invest in low carbon paths to sustainable development. The term deforestation
                                            refers to the permanent removal of forests and withdrawal of land from forest use, whereas the term forest degradation refers to detrimental changes that limit a forest’s production
                                            capacity.  A relevant question pertains to the persistence component of degradation, i.e., is a forest degraded if it recovers from detrimental change that only temporarily limits 
                                            its productivity? The overall objective of the proposal is to elaborate the definition of degradation by clarifying the persistence component.  The research questions are primarily
                                            methodological in nature with anticipated outcomes relating to the utility of remotely sensed data for assessing forest degradation.  To address these questions, three kinds of will

                                            Previous studies conducted at Antimary State Forest (western Brazilian Amazon) have indicated that low-intensity selective logging activities can be detected using three-dimensional canopy 
                                            structure information derived from measurements from airborne laser scanning data (d’Oliveira et al., 2012). Using very-high-density lidar data (> 24 pulses/sq.m.), a relative density model
                                            (RDM) can be developed that represents the density of lidar returns (and vegetation) within a layer in the forest canopy between 1 and 5 meters height above ground. Variability 
                                            in the density within this layer was found to be highly sensitive to forest impacts associated with selective logging, such as the development of skid trails and logging roads. A more recent
                                            study utilized multi-temporal airborne lidar data sets to quantify the reduction in biomass/aboveground carbon due to selective logging activities (Andersen et al., in review). This study 
                                            showed that even relatively low levels of biomass change (10-20 Mg/ha) could be detected and quantified using changes observed in airborne lidar structural metrics. While the results of
                                            these studies are highly encouraging and indicate the potential utility of airborne lidar as a tool in detecting and characterizing forest degradation in tropical areas, there are several
                                            remaining critical research questions that will determine practical value of lidar for this application. For example, it is unclear how much the lidar density can be reduced and still
                                            maintain an adequate level of accuracy. The lidar data used in these studies was very high density (24 pulses/sq.m. and 10 pulses/sq.m. for 2010 and 2011 data respectively). While these
                                            densities were appropriate for research studies, they are not economically feasible for large-area acquisitions, where we would expect densities closer to 1-4 pulses/sq.m.
