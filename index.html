									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										Tropical deforestation and forest degradation pose a serious threat to people, economies, and biodiversity worldwide. Tropical forests continue to decline at an alarming rate, undermining
										economic development and exacerbating social and environmental challenges. To address this concern, decision makers in tropical countries need more and better information about how forests 
										and other landscapes are changing over time. There is a growing need for improved information about changes in forest and terrestrial carbon, in particular, to guide forest and land use 
										management and planning, track and meet national sustainable development goals, and curb forest loss through approaches such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation
										(REDD+).
									</p>
									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										Many tropical countries have prioritized the establishment of national forest and landscape monitoring systems. These systems combine remote sensing data with ground-based forest inventory 
										data to generate up-to-date information about forest and landscape dynamics and associated carbon dynamics. This information is essential for sustainably managing natural resources, combatting
										illegal logging, and addressing climate change, as well as fulfilling national and international reporting commitments. National forest and landscape monitoring systems also increase
										transparency and accountability, helping to level the international playing field for trade and private investment. 
									</p>                                                                                     
									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										Recent years have seen the rapid advancement of forest and landscape monitoring science and technology. This includes impressive improvements in satellite data availability and quality along
										with improved ground measurements, enhanced modeling capabilities, and increased knowledge through research. In order to take full advantage of these opportunities, countries must build the
										technical capacity needed to identify and adapt the monitoring technologies that best suit their national circumstances, and be able to operationalize those technologies in an integrated
										national system that supports multiple objectives. Technical cooperation plays an essential role in supporting countries to develop robust, cost-effective forest and landscape monitoring
										systems that are sustainable over the long term.
									</p>
									<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
										With this in mind, US federal agencies have joined together to create the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon capitalizes on the accumulated expertise of the US scientific and technical community
										to build capacity for monitoring, measuring, and reporting forest and terrestrial carbon. SilvaCarbon supports national forest and landscape monitoring efforts in partner countries by working
										directly with in-country technical teams and program leaders, identifying and disseminating good practices and cost-effective technologies, and facilitating technical cooperation at national,
										regional, and international levels.

										Better information on forest, landscape, and terrestrial carbon dynamics help countries improve the management of these critical natural resources. Better planning, managing, and monitoring forests
										and other landscapes can help reduce vulnerability to natural disasters, increase economic activities, and support better governance. Enhanced transparency leads to better accountability to domestic
										and international stakeholders. These actions often also lead to a better investment and sourcing environment for the private sector.

											<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
												Bangladesh’s biologically rich forests and wetlands, including the internationally recognized Sundarbans mangrove forest, provide crucial economic, social, and environmental benefits for
												the country, region, and world. As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries on Earth, Bangladesh depends on its forests and wetlands for protection against climate-related impacts such
												as catastrophic floods and other disasters. The country has lost over half of its forests in the last 30 years, however, and its remaining forested areas are critically threatened.
											</p>
											<p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
												The Government of Bangladesh is committed to slowing forest loss by participating in REDD+, and by building relevant technical capacities across government, civil society, and industry. As
												part of those efforts, the BFD has prioritized the development of a national forest monitoring system that leverages the strengths of both ground-based forest inventory data and remote
												sensing data. SilvaCarbon is working with FAO to help the BFD achieve this goal, with coordination support from SilvaCarbon staff based in Dhaka.

                                            Degraded forests are poorly studied. Despite the rapidly accumulating number of lidar studies, degraded forests are rarely used for calibration. With the exception of some long-term

                                            In this proposal, the research team proposes an alternative method for monitoring land change that makes use of all available observations ever acquired by the Landsat
                                            satellite for a pixel. Studying a time series of observations rather than comparing individual images or maps makes it possible to continuously monitor the land cover at
                                            pixel-level in time. While never implemented in Colombia, the proposed methodology has proven capable of mapping stable and changing land cover with high levels of

                                            In Central African countries, where deforestation has historically been low, but where logging occurs in over 70% of the forests in some countries, forest degradation may
                                            be the most important source of carbon emissions. The uncertainty in quantifying the area affected and the carbon loss through degradation, particularly from selective logging,
                                            is large because conventional methods of remote sensing and surveying are not sensitive enough to precisely measure degradation. However, advances in high resolution remote

                                            attribute mapping relies on a set of modeled, pixel-based estimates, generally in the form of a map derived from remotely sensed data. Precision estimates can come from 
                                            analyzing the set of pixel values, their uncertainties, and their spatial covariance. Model-assisted estimation is based on a probabilistic design in which ground plots
                                            along with auxiliary data from maps derived from remote sensing are used to generate estimates of forest parameters and their variance.

                                            But does tropical forest degradation lead to permanent carbon losses?  This is a critical question to address in the context of policy discussions to implement REDD+ (Reduced Emissions

                                            Deforestation and forest degradation account for nearly 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any sector other than the energy sector (UN REDD, 2009). REDD (Reducing 
                                            Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) is a mechanism designed under the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change to financially

                                            refers to the permanent removal of forests and withdrawal of land from forest use, whereas the term forest degradation refers to detrimental changes that limit a forest’s production
                                            capacity.  A relevant question pertains to the persistence component of degradation, i.e., is a forest degraded if it recovers from detrimental change that only temporarily limits

                                            Previous studies conducted at Antimary State Forest (western Brazilian Amazon) have indicated that low-intensity selective logging activities can be detected using three-dimensional canopy 
                                            structure information derived from measurements from airborne laser scanning data (d’Oliveira et al., 2012). Using very-high-density lidar data (> 24 pulses/sq.m.), a relative density model
                                            (RDM) can be developed that represents the density of lidar returns (and vegetation) within a layer in the forest canopy between 1 and 5 meters height above ground. Variability 
                                            in the density within this layer was found to be highly sensitive to forest impacts associated with selective logging, such as the development of skid trails and logging roads. A more recent
                                            study utilized multi-temporal airborne lidar data sets to quantify the reduction in biomass/aboveground carbon due to selective logging activities (Andersen et al., in review). This study 
                                            showed that even relatively low levels of biomass change (10-20 Mg/ha) could be detected and quantified using changes observed in airborne lidar structural metrics. While the results of
                                            these studies are highly encouraging and indicate the potential utility of airborne lidar as a tool in detecting and characterizing forest degradation in tropical areas, there are several
                                            remaining critical research questions that will determine practical value of lidar for this application. For example, it is unclear how much the lidar density can be reduced and still
                                            maintain an adequate level of accuracy. The lidar data used in these studies was very high density (24 pulses/sq.m. and 10 pulses/sq.m. for 2010 and 2011 data respectively). While these
                                            densities were appropriate for research studies, they are not economically feasible for large-area acquisitions, where we would expect densities closer to 1-4 pulses/sq.m.

                                            We propose to investigate whether the quality of 1)the lidar-derived terrain model, 2) the information provided by the RDM and 3) the lidar-based measurement of changes in biomass/carbon
                                            via a model-based approach is sensitive to the density of the airborne lidar data, and provide recommendations as to the lowest lidar density (i.e. most economical) that still yields
                                            acceptable results for these three applications.
