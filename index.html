                                        SilvaCarbon provides targeted technical support to countries in the process of developing and implementing national forest monitoring systems. Drawing on the expertise of multiple
                                        US Government agencies and other partners, the program leverages cutting-edge science and technology to advance the generation and use of improved information related to forest 
                                        and terrestrial carbon.
                                    </h5>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                        Tropical deforestation and forest degradation pose a serious threat to people, economies, and biodiversity worldwide. Vital forest resources continue to disappear at an alarming
                                        rate in many tropical countries, undermining economic development and exacerbating social and environmental challenges. To address this concern, decision makers need more and better
                                        information about how forests and other landscapes are changing over time. There is a growing need for improved information about changes in forest and terrestrial carbon, in
                                        particular, to strengthen forest and land use management and planning, track and meet sustainable development goals, and curb forest loss through incentive mechanisms such as
                                        Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+).
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                        Recognizing this need, many tropical countries have prioritized the establishment of national forest monitoring systems. National forest monitoring systems integrate satellite 
                                        imagery and other remote sensing data with ground-based forest inventory data to generate accurate, up-to-date information about forest dynamics and associated carbon dynamics. 
                                        Forest monitoring information is essential for guiding decisions related to a variety of national and international objectives, including conserving forests and biodiversity, 
                                        combatting illegal logging and associated transnational crime, and responding to global climate change. National forest monitoring systems also contribute to greater overall 
                                        transparency and accountability, helping to level the playing field for international trade and other multilateral initiatives.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="divcenter tleft bottommargin-verysm">
                                        Recent years have seen the rapid advancement of forest and carbon monitoring science and technology. This includes impressive improvements in satellite data availability and
                                        quality, along with improved ground measurements, enhanced modeling capabilities, and increased knowledge through research. International collaboration is particularly critical
                                        now for supporting the establishment of robust, sustainable national forest monitoring systems that are appropriate to countries’ individual circumstances.

                                        With this in mind, US federal agencies have joined together to create the SilvaCarbon program. SilvaCarbon capitalizes on the accumulated expertise of the US scientific and 
                                        technical community to build capacity worldwide for monitoring, measuring, and managing forest and terrestrial carbon. In collaboration with developing nations and other partners,

                                            The shared language, depth of experiences, and ongoing communication and technical support across Latin and America and the Caribbean contribute to excellent opportunities
                                            for South-South collaboration. SilvaCarbon capitalizes on these opportunities by providing country-specific support to individual countries and facilitating cooperation and 
                                            knowledge exchange at the regional level. SilvaCarbon began working with the Andean Amazon countries of Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru in 2011, and expanded to include the
                                            Central American and Caribbean countries of Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama in 2014.

                                            to assist governments to measure and monitor forest emissions. While this assistance has significantly advanced the use of remote sensing products and the implementation of
                                            forest inventories, technical capacity gaps remain, and countries seek further assistance related to reporting, mitigation activities, and strengthening in-country

                                                    and statistical robustness of the national forest inventory; (2) integrating remote sensing data with ground-based data to support an improved understanding of forest
                                                    cover and change over time; and (3) strengthening the national GHG inventory for the land sectors.

                                                    industry, and by participating in REDD+. As part of those efforts, the country has recently begun developing its first national forest monitoring system. The responsible
                                                    agency, the Bangladesh Forest Department (BFD), has prioritized the development of a robust, sustainable, and cost-effective national forest monitoring system that leverages

                                            support from the Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE). CARPE, funded by USAID, is the primary US Government environmental program in the region and the 
                                            largest USAID conservation program in the world. A principle CARPE objective is to strengthen capacities to monitor forest cover change, GHG emissions, and biodiversity. In all

                                            The Central African Congo Basin is the second-largest humid tropical forest in the world, harboring incredible biodiversity and carbon in its dense interior. The vast forested
                                            landscapes of the Congo Basin also provide essential environmental services to surrounding communities, and are widely recognized as a global priority for forest conservation
                                            and management. A number of Congo Basin countries have committed to reducing forest loss and associated emissions and are working closely with international partners to achieve
                                            their goals. Recognizing that sustainable forest management cannot be achieved without reliable forest data, stakeholders in Central Africa have requested technical support in
                                            developing cost-effective forest monitoring approaches that are suited to the region’s large, dense, and remote forested areas.

                                            In this proposal, the research team proposes an alternative method for monitoring land change that makes use of all available observations ever acquired by the Landsat
                                            satellite for a pixel. Studying a time series of observations rather than comparing individual images or maps makes it possible to continuously monitor the land cover at
                                            pixel-level in time. While never implemented in Colombia, the proposed methodology has proven capable of mapping stable and changing land cover with high levels of

                                            In Central African countries, where deforestation has historically been low, but where logging occurs in over 70% of the forests in some countries, forest degradation may
                                            be the most important source of carbon emissions. The uncertainty in quantifying the area affected and the carbon loss through degradation, particularly from selective logging,
                                            is large because conventional methods of remote sensing and surveying are not sensitive enough to precisely measure degradation. However, advances in high resolution remote

                                            There are two general approaches to carbon estimation that show promise for MRV-model-based and model-assisted estimation. Model-based estimation in the context of forest
                                            attribute mapping relies on a set of modeled, pixel-based estimates, generally in the form of a map derived from remotely sensed data. Precision estimates can come from 
                                            analyzing the set of pixel values, their uncertainties, and their spatial covariance. Model-assisted estimation is based on a probabilistic design in which ground plots
                                            along with auxiliary data from maps derived from remote sensing are used to generate estimates of forest parameters and their variance.

                                            Deforestation and forest degradation account for nearly 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any sector other than the energy sector (UN REDD, 2009). REDD (Reducing 
                                            Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) is a mechanism designed under the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change to financially
                                            support developing countries that are willing and able to reduce emissions from deforestation and invest in low carbon paths to sustainable development. The term deforestation
                                            refers to the permanent removal of forests and withdrawal of land from forest use, whereas the term forest degradation refers to detrimental changes that limit a forest’s production
                                            capacity.  A relevant question pertains to the persistence component of degradation, i.e., is a forest degraded if it recovers from detrimental change that only temporarily limits 
                                            its productivity? The overall objective of the proposal is to elaborate the definition of degradation by clarifying the persistence component.  The research questions are primarily
                                            methodological in nature with anticipated outcomes relating to the utility of remotely sensed data for assessing forest degradation.  To address these questions, three kinds of will

                                            Previous studies conducted at Antimary State Forest (western Brazilian Amazon) have indicated that low-intensity selective logging activities can be detected using three-dimensional canopy 
                                            structure information derived from measurements from airborne laser scanning data (d’Oliveira et al., 2012). Using very-high-density lidar data (> 24 pulses/sq.m.), a relative density model
                                            (RDM) can be developed that represents the density of lidar returns (and vegetation) within a layer in the forest canopy between 1 and 5 meters height above ground. Variability 
                                            in the density within this layer was found to be highly sensitive to forest impacts associated with selective logging, such as the development of skid trails and logging roads. A more recent
                                            study utilized multi-temporal airborne lidar data sets to quantify the reduction in biomass/aboveground carbon due to selective logging activities (Andersen et al., in review). This study 
                                            showed that even relatively low levels of biomass change (10-20 Mg/ha) could be detected and quantified using changes observed in airborne lidar structural metrics. While the results of
                                            these studies are highly encouraging and indicate the potential utility of airborne lidar as a tool in detecting and characterizing forest degradation in tropical areas, there are several
                                            remaining critical research questions that will determine practical value of lidar for this application. For example, it is unclear how much the lidar density can be reduced and still
                                            maintain an adequate level of accuracy. The lidar data used in these studies was very high density (24 pulses/sq.m. and 10 pulses/sq.m. for 2010 and 2011 data respectively). While these
                                            densities were appropriate for research studies, they are not economically feasible for large-area acquisitions, where we would expect densities closer to 1-4 pulses/sq.m.

                                            via a model-based approach is sensitive to the density of the airborne lidar data, and provide recommendations as to the lowest lidar density (i.e. most economical) that still yields
